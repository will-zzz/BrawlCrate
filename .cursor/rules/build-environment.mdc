# Build Environment: macOS Host + Windows VM (Parallels)

The developer works on macOS with files synced to a Windows VM via Parallels.

## When giving instructions or commands, always specify the environment:

- **macOS (Cursor/host)**: Git operations, file editing, code review, searching, non-build terminal commands
- **Windows VM (Parallels)**: Building the solution, running BrawlCrate.exe, Visual Studio operations, msbuild/dotnet build, cargo build, NuGet restore, running/debugging the app

## Examples

- "Run this in **Windows VM**: `msbuild BrawlCrateTools.sln /p:Configuration=Debug /p:Platform=x86`"
- "Run this on **macOS**: `git checkout -b feature/golf-maps`"

## Key constraint

BrawlCrate targets .NET Framework 4.7.2 + WinForms, so it can only build and run on Windows. Never suggest building or running the app on macOS.
